    <p>When you create a website, an “About Us” page is one of those must-haves that you cannot neglect. Every website has one, from big eCommerce brands to someone’s blog. It provides an opportunity for visitors to get to know your business. With a compelling “About Us” page, you can immediately establish connections with people who landed on your site. There is no hard structure to it, and it’s not always easy to know what to include in such a section. In this post, I’ll go into detail about what information you should consider including, the dos and don’ts, and how to set up an About section in WordPress.

    Why do you need an About Us page?
    So, people have landed on your site. They already saw the homepage where you introduce your blog, products, or services. Now they want to find more information about the person or people behind the products or services you offer. This is when they look for your “About Us” page – to know more about you! The page can go by different names – “About”, “Our story” – but their purpose is the same. To tell visitors who you are, and why they should choose your business!
    
    When visitors first land on your site, you’re a stranger to them. Use this page to explain to them what it is that you do, and why you do it. They should be presented with clear information about you or your business.
    
    Don’t think of this section as an obligation and only write a few paragraphs here and there. This is a wonderful opportunity for you to share your stories, values and build trust between you and your site visitors. When people know who you are, what you do, what you believe in, they are more likely to trust and do business with you.
    
    What information should you include on your About Us page?
    There are so many ways you can go about telling your company story. It’s tough to establish a one-size-fits-all structure for an About page. In general, try to think about what you want visitors to know about you, and what you think they want to know. In addition to that, your brand personality should speak loud and clear here. Let visitors know whom they are doing business with!
    
    The following list is just a suggestion of the various information you could have on your “About Us” page, regardless of the purpose of your website. You don’t need to include all of it on your page. Choose the information that you think is suitable for your business.
    
    Your story
    Every business has a story to tell. We believe an “About” page should always include a piece of the story about you or your company. This is especially true for bloggers and smaller companies. People love brands with personalities nowadays. And stories are powerful mediums for you to connect with your audience. People tell stories. It’s what we do as humans!
    
    How did you come up with the idea of this blog or this company? When did you decide to pursue this idea? How has it grown during all those times? Don’t be afraid to summarize and share such experiences in a piece of writing. Try to encapsulate your history and development in just a few paragraphs. You don’t have to be a book author to write one, and you certainly don’t need to make it lengthy.
    
    You should definitely mention the “Aha!” moment that led to the creation of your blog, products, or services. In addition to that, you may want to include the important milestones that you or your company achieve over time. Milestones are your company’s history, so be proud of them! And who knows, you might inspire some visitors with your compelling story and</p>
